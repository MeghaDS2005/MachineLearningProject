##End to end Machine Learning Project
The project aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing information about students' academic performance. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize the data. The primary objectives include predictive analytics, discovering correlations between variables and building statistical models to predict student performance. 
The performance of different classifiers was compared before choosing the best and tuning it (including feature engineering) to obtain optimal results. Deployed the project using AWS EC2 Instance.
